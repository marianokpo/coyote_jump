**Coyote Jump** is a plugin for the Godot 4.x engine that adds two essential features to any responsive 2D platformer:

- **Coyote Time**: allows the player to jump shortly after leaving a platform.
- **Jump Buffer**: queues a jump input pressed just before landing, preventing missed jumps.

Perfect for making platformers feel smooth, forgiving, and professional.
